####  BalLeRMix---*Bal*ancing selection *L*ik*e*lihood *R*atio *Mix*ture models

This repository hosts the software package for BalLeRMix and scripts used in the study "*Flexible mixture model approaches that accommodate footprint size variability for robust detection of balancing selection*" (Cheng &amp; DeGiorgio 2019, Submitted). 

- For the software, go to `BalLeRMix/software/`
- For scripts used for SLiM simulations, go to `BalLeRMix/Simulation_scripts/`
- For scripts used in empirical analyses,  go to `BalLeRMix/Empirical_analysis/`
